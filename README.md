# Country-Happiness-HRD-Analysis

# Introduction 

Happiness is considered an important and useful way to guide a country’s public policy and measure its effectiveness. A happy citizen will have good health, consequently contributing to the economy and growth of the country. Utilizing data from social welfare reports, such as the Gallup World Poll, we can produce a statistical analysis about the situation of a country and compare it with other countries across the globe.

From this motivation, the report analysis will address two questions in our report: 1. How does the mean happiness score in Western Europe compare to the overall mean happiness score from all countries? 2. Does the happiness score vary by the freedom experienced by a country? We want to analyze Western Europe’s mean happiness score as it is universally known that Scandinavian countries are generally happier. Additionally, since the data mainly divides countries according to regions and shows the happiness score for each of them, we thought comparing the happiness scores of one region against the other regions would help us explore the data deeply. For our second question, the main purpose of our analysis is to identify if there is a linear relationship between freedom and the happiness score. Since freedom is positively correlated with happiness, we assume a country with a high freedom score will have a higher overall happiness score.
